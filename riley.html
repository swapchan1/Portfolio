          <h2>Overview</h2>
        </header>

        <div class="content" style="text-align: justify">

          <h3>Background:</h3>
          <p>ICANSCAN is a project sponsored by the Pediatric Neurologist, Dr. M. Golomb at Riley Hospital For Children At Indiana
            University Health located in Indianapolis, Indiana. The project is about the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
            procedure, which is a medical imaging procedure for making images of the internal structures of the body.
            <a href="https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/MRI/default.htm">(Reference)</a>
          </p>

          <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
          <p>The MRI procedure is loud and requires the patient to be still for the complete duration which varies between 20
            minutes to 90 minutes. This makes the children nervous, scared and fidgety and if the scans aren’t accurate,
            the procedure is repeated, which costs the parents thousands of dollars again. </p>
          <p>
            Due to this fear and lack of awareness, the children and parents opt for anesthesia for the procedure. Although safe, anesthesia
            should not be the preferred choice for parents as it is not needed for this procedure as well as it delays the
            diagnosis and the treatment. The statistics show the number of MRI units owned country-wise for 6 countries.
            This shows that there is a high demand for MRI scans, making the above a serious problem.</p>
          <h3>Solution:</h3>
          <p>The team felt that informing the parents and children about the procedure and about what to expect might reduce
            their fears. Therefore, we designed and developed an interactive VR application for children and an interactive
            iPad website for the parents to prepare them for the procedure. This would lead them to make an informed decision
            about the anesthesia, instead of a decision out of fear.</p>
          <div style="width:400px; display: inline-block;">
            <h3>My Role:</h3>
            <p>This project was a team effort. I was the designer for the project and worked along with a VR developer. As the
              designer, I designed the VR app and the iPad website. I also developed the iPad website.</p>
            <h3>Duration:</h3>
            <p>2 years</p>
            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <!--<p>We followed the following steps to go about the problem:</p>-->
            <ol>
              <li>Understanding the problem</li>
              <li>Persona</li>
              <li>Low-fidelity sketches</li>
              <li>Hi-fidelity Prototype</li>
              <li>User Testing</li>
              <li>Re-design</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Tools used:</h3>

          <h2>Our Process</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="content" style="text-align: justify">
          <h3>1. Understanding the Problem</h3>
          <p>Our client, Dr. Golomb has been working with children for many years. Through her 24+ years of experience we understand
            that MRI can be scary for children due to the loud noise and restriction of movement.</p>
          <p>My teammate and I tried the MRI for 15 minutes each to empathize with a young child. </p>

          <h3>2. Persona</h3>
          <p>Our persona was decided by the client:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: circle">
            <li>A child between the age 3 years to 15 years who is required to take an MRI exam. Keeping this in mind, we began
              to think about ways to make our solution acceptable and fun to play with for the young children.</li>
            <li>A Parent. We wanted the parent to see what the child is seeing in the interactive VR application and inform them
              about the details of the procedure. </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Prototype</h3>
          <p>The final prototype took many iterations. The final iteration is:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Interactive VR Application: This application gave the children a great and close to reality experience of a MRI
              scan. </li>
            <li>Interactive Website: This website walked the parents through many steps and questions related to MRI scans. This
              website also briefed the parent on how the VR application helped prepare the Child for the actual MRI scan
            </li>
          </ul>



          <h3>4. Developemnt</h3>
          <p>After designing, I developed the website in </p>
          <ul>
            <li> HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>Javascript </li>

        <div class="content" style="text-align: justify">
          <p>I interned with Riley Physicians under Dr. Golomb in summer 2017 to conduct a IRS approved user test of the project.
            I was given the responsibility to observe, demonstrate and guide the users during their user testing.</p>
          <p>I interviewed 96 participants (45 children and 51 parents/guardians) and recorded their reviews. </p>
          The test protocol was:
          <ul>

            <li>Observe them while they intuitively click on the applications (Fly-on-the-wall obervations)</li>
            <li>>Ask them questions as they play with the applications (Semi-structured interview)</li>
            <li>Conduct a small final questionnaire to get the user’s feedback (Formal interview)</li>
